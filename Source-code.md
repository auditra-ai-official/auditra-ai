  Auditra AI – Core System Design (High-Level)

  NOTICE:
  We do not provide public access to Auditra AI’s source code at this time.
  This is an intentional decision based on the following reasons:

  1. Auditra AI is the product of significant multi-year engineering, research, and compliance expertise. The current codebase encodes not only technical solutions, but deep, hard-won knowledge of real-world regulatory, cloud, and adversarial scenarios.
  2. We believe that in the rapidly evolving field of AI compliance and risk, true security and effectiveness depends on responsible disclosure and careful partnership. Open-sourcing at this stage would risk both misuse and dilution of techniques that are best validated in close collaboration with trusted stakeholders.
  3. We are committed to transparency with our partners and clients. Full source access, audits, and even co-development opportunities are available for serious collaborators. If you are interested in working with us—reach out.

  Thank you for your understanding and respect for the labor and vision that goes into this work.

  System Overview – How Our Model Works (2025)

  Auditra AI currently integrates multiple core modules and a hybrid engine to deliver compliance detection, reporting, and patching:

    1. Dataflow and Application Graph Builder
      - Ingests cloud configs, container manifests, CI/CD pipelines, ML code, API routes, data schemas.
      - Constructs an end-to-end graph of application dataflows, privilege boundaries, and resource access.
      - Enables detection of “hidden” compliance triggers (data leakage, shadow retention, unlogged ML outputs).

    2. Compliance Signature and Pattern Engine
      - Uses a mix of LLM-based and symbolic rules to match known and emerging regulatory issues.
      - Continuously updated from global compliance events, breach disclosures, and new legislation.

    3. Contextual Threat Simulation
      - Simulates adversarial behaviors (e.g., shadow admin, internal leak, algorithmic bias) in sandboxed environments.
      - Validates not only presence but exploitability of potential compliance failures.

    4. Patch Generation & Validation
      - For every confirmed finding, generates deployable code/policy or infrastructure-as-code (IaC) updates.
      - Validates patches in disposable cloud environments before proposing them to clients.

    5. Audit Trail and Evidence Module
      - Automatically produces human-readable, timestamped reports for regulators, clients, and investors.

  Our engine is built in Python, TypeScript, and Rust, with cloud integrations for AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes. The model pipeline combines transformer-based LLMs for code/policy reasoning with symbolic graph logic for traceability and explainability.

  Roadmap – How We’re Improving

  - Deeper Integration: Adding support for serverless, edge, and distributed database compliance detection (beyond classical VMs and containers).
  - Proactive Monitoring: Moving from snapshot audits to real-time, streaming compliance alerts as code/data moves through the cloud.
  - Self-Healing Pipelines: Automating not just patch suggestions but live “compliance guardrails” that enforce policy at build or deploy time.
  - Explainable AI: Publishing detailed “why” and “how” explanations with every detection, so developers and legal teams can reason about compliance risk together.
  - Open Regulatory Graph: Working with select partners to build an open, versioned map of all major global AI/data privacy requirements—so clients can track where and how risk changes over time.
