## About Us

Auditra AI is built by security engineers and AI architects who have spent years inside cloud, banking, and critical infrastructure.  
We know where real compliance risk hides (and how checklists or static scans fail). That’s why we created Auditra:  
A platform for **serious, explainable compliance**—built for production, not just audits.

## What Makes Auditra Different

- **Dynamic Dataflow & Threat Modeling:**  
  Maps your real app, cloud, and ML stack—goes way beyond static code checks.
- **LLM & Symbolic Hybrid Engine:**  
  Correlates business logic, access control, and new regulatory laws in real time.
- **Actionable Patching:**  
  Generates precise fixes, policy updates, and can even validate in a sandbox before you touch production.
- **Regulatory Simulations:**  
  Simulates regulatory audits (EU AI Act, GDPR, more) so you see issues *before* regulators do.

## Who Uses Auditra?

- **Cloud Providers:**  
  - Audit workloads, dataflows, configs—across hybrid/multi-cloud.
  - Produce proof-of-compliance artifacts on demand.
- **Banks/Fintech:**  
  - Trace sensitive data from ingestion to output, including inside ML/AI black boxes.
  - “Living” compliance docs updated with every code/infra change.
- **SaaS Startups:**  
  - Ship faster without risking compliance disaster or expensive retrofits.

## Why This Matters

> **We have already provided a vulnerability found by our program within the OPENAI platform, which will help them prevent lawsuits from the EU ACT.**
>
> We’re not theorists—we run real audits, build our own exploits, and have been called to advise on high-profile compliance investigations.

## Roadmap

- **Immediate:** CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins), expanded coverage of US/Asia frameworks.
- **Q4 2025:** Patch validation API as a service.
- **2026:** Universal multi-cloud compliance automation, explainable AI for regulatory teams.
